## Personal Workload Management

This extension focuses on **your** work, not project-level oversight. Your personal Redmine dashboard — find issues, plan work, log time.

### Setup Requirements

1. **Redmine URL** - Your server's HTTPS address (e.g., `https://redmine.example.com`)
2. **API Key** - Found in Redmine under *My Account* → *API access key*

Credentials stored securely in your system's encrypted keychain.

### The Workflow

**Issues** → **Kanban** → **Today's Plan** → **Time Entries**

Find work, stage it, time it, log it.
